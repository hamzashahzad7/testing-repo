# AI Usage Report

This document outlines where and how AI tools were used in the development of this project.

---

## 🤖 AI Tools Used

- **ChatGPT (GPT-4)**

---

## 📝 Prompts That Were Most Effective

1. **Fixing background gradient scaling**
   - Prompt:  
     *"I want the bg-gradient to cover all the height the section has but it's not getting all the height ... my code below of that component"*

---

## 💻 Code Sections Assisted by AI

- **Background gradient height fixation**  
  AI suggested adjustments using Tailwind utilities like `min-h-full`, `h-full`, and parent-relative positioning to ensure the gradient dynamically covers the entire section height.

---

## ✅ Validation of AI-Generated Code

- Reviewed AI’s suggested CSS/Tailwind utilities against Figma design.
- Verified visually by resizing the browser window to test responsiveness.
- Removed unused or redundant class suggestions after testing.

---

## 🧩 Challenges Where AI Helped

- **Dynamic background gradient height:**  
  Initially, the gradient was only partially covering the section. With AI guidance, the issue was resolved by aligning absolute positioning and height utilities with the parent container.

## ⚠️ Notes

- AI was **not** used for core logic or project scaffolding.  
- Only specific styling/bug-fix assistance was requested.
